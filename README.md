Kalman Filter:
The implementation provides a flexible framework for simulating and estimating the trajectory of a ball using a Kalman Filter, demonstrating its utility in tracking systems subject to noise and uncertainties in observations. 
Adjustments can be made to parameters and noise levels to observe their effects on estimation accuracy.

Particle filter:
The implementation of the Particle Filter to estimate the positions and velocity vectors of two balls flying simultaneously only from the observed erroneous positions over time
